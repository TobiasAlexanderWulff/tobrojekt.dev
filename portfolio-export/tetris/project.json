  "summary": "Modern TypeScript Tetris in a tidy monorepo: a small core engine plus a Vite + React web app with configurable controls, audio, and local highscores.",
  "description": "This project is a pragmatic Tetris implementation organized as a two‑package monorepo: `@tetris/core` for engine scaffolding and `@tetris/web` for the playable web client. The web app renders to an HTML5 canvas and targets a smooth 60 FPS experience with a clean UI, including Settings for DAS/ARR, 180° rotation, themes, animation toggles, mouse controls, and audio preferences. Local highscores are built in with export/import and clearing utilities.\n\nThe codebase favors modularity and testability: TypeScript throughout, Vite for fast dev/build, Vitest and Testing Library for unit/UI tests, and ESLint/Prettier for consistency. Audio is abstracted via a small service and a Web Audio adapter, mapping engine events (line clears, tetris, level up) to SFX and music in a future‑proof way.\n\nThis MVP lays groundwork toward a guideline‑inspired ruleset (SRS, 7‑bag, scoring, ghost, hold, next queue) and keeps project hygiene front‑and‑center: workspace scripts, CI hooks, and a documented plan for larger features like mouse input and audio.",
