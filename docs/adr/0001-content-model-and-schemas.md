# ADR 0001: Content Model and Schemas

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-09-14

## Context
The siteâ€™s purpose is to showcase and manage projects with clarity and room to grow. A stable, tech-agnostic content model enables consistent authoring, validation, and future portability across stacks or frameworks.

## Decision
Define a minimal-but-extensible content model for Projects, Tags/Categories, and Site Metadata. Provide JSON Schema definitions under `config/schemas/` to document and validate structure in a technology-neutral way. Example content lives under `content/` to illustrate the model.

## Consequences
- Pros:
  - Clear, shared understanding of fields and invariants.
  - Early validation reduces drift and broken assumptions.
  - Neutral foundation supports future stack choices and migrations.
- Cons:
  - Schemas may require evolution as needs expand.
  - Strict validation can require migrations when fields change.
- Mitigations:
  - Use semantic versioning for schema changes when releases begin.
  - Record breaking changes and migration notes in docs and CHANGELOG.
