# tobrojekt.dev

Personal projects hub and portfolio for tobrojekt.dev. This repository will evolve to manage, present, and grow Tobias’s projects over time.

This repo is intentionally tech‑agnostic at this stage. For overarching goals, workflow, and quality standards, see `AGENTS.md`.

## Vision
- Central, accurate source for all relevant projects.
- Simple to maintain, easy to extend as needs grow.
- Strong defaults for accessibility, performance, and privacy.

## Project Structure (initial)
- `content/projects/` — project entries and metadata placeholders
- `content/tags/` — tag/category metadata placeholders
- `public/` — public static assets (e.g., favicons, social images)
- `assets/` — raw media to prepare/optimize for `public/`
- `config/` — site metadata, feature flags, redirects map (future)
- `docs/` — documentation, ADRs, design notes (see `docs/adr/`)
- `tests/` — automated checks (structure depends on chosen stack)

## Getting Started
- Technology stack and setup instructions will be added later once selected.
- In the meantime, content model and workflow guidance live in `AGENTS.md`.

## Content Model
See tech‑neutral fields and invariants in `AGENTS.md` (Projects, Tags/Categories, Site Metadata). Stack‑specific schemas will be documented separately once selected.

## Roadmap
High‑level milestones (M0–M4) are outlined in `AGENTS.md` under Features & Roadmap.

## Contributing
- Follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` (operating principles, DoD, validation).
- For notable decisions, add a short ADR under `docs/adr/`.

## Changelog
See `CHANGELOG.md` for notable changes.
